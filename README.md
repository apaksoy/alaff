Solutions to various homework questions or recommended exercises from [Advanced Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.ALA+1T2020/course/) taught in Winter 2020 at edX. 

Although Matlab has been used in the course, the programming files here are usually in Python as iPython notebooks. After doing the exercises in Matlab whenever required, I did them (and my own extra course projects) also in Python to learn Python better.
